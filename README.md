# TextEncoderDecoderApp
This Python script allows you to encode and decode text using a simple substitution cipher. It provides an easy way to transform your messages for privacy or amusement.

How It Works
The script uses a predefined substitution code to encode and decode text. Each letter is replaced with a corresponding code, and vice versa. You can choose to encode or decode your text based on your preference.

Getting Started
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

Clone or download this repository to your computer.

Run the script by executing python text_encoder_decoder.py in your terminal or command prompt.

Usage
To encode a text, press (E) or (e) when prompted, and then enter the text you want to encode.

To decode a text, press (D) or (d) when prompted, and then enter the encoded text.

The script will display the result on the screen.

Customization
You can modify the substitution code in the code dictionary to create your own encoding scheme. Feel free to add more characters or symbols for encoding.

Example
Here's an example of how to use the script:

Run the script.

Choose (E) to encode or (D) to decode.

Enter your text.

View the encoded or decoded text on the screen.

Stopping the App
To exit the script, simply press Ctrl + C in the terminal or command prompt.
